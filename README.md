# Android-Multi-Function-App-
This app, built during my 21-day Netcamp internship, features a Camera, Music Player, Torch, Video Player, and secure User Authentication system. It uses Firebase for backend services, managing user authentication and data securely. The project demonstrates my skills in Android development, media handling, and Firebase integration.
